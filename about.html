        <h2>How RateMyCourse was created</h2>

        <time datetime="06-23-2021">June 29, 2021</time>
        <p>
            <em> RateMyCourse</em>
            was created to allow students from different universites
            to check with others in their university to see which courses
            would be suitable for them based on their majors and class needed 
            left before graduation. This website allows people to check with 
            other students in their major to see what classes they can take and whether or not it would 
            this class would be suitable for them. You can filter through enjoyment of the class, diffuctly, overall experience, and grade recieved.
            
        </p>

        <h3>How Was The Idea Created</h3>
        <p> I first discovered this idea, as there were many people I saw struggling find courses
            in time before registration was being filled up. This gave me the idea to create a platform
            for people to discover courses for that fulfill their major requirements and would be a enjoyable class for them,
            as a lot of times this not been the case for me.
        </p>

        <h3>What Has Been Done So Far</h3>
        <p> Currently, the website allows for people to enter their university, 
            and see the enjoyment of the class, diffuctly,overall experience, and grade recieved. Students are able to 
            give a one through five star rating out of these three filters. You can also see what professors students have taken and 
            see if this professor has gotten good reviews for that class.
        </p>

        <h3>What Will Need To Be Done(Updates)</h3>
        <p> We will be implementing more filters for people. 
            We will also in the future allow for suggestions to people based on the classes they have taken and see if that class would
            be a good match for them.
            <strong> This will allow students to see what classes are suited for them, and tailor them to pick their classes based on the indicators</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
        <p> The best way to contact us would be through email, and that is 
            <strong> Contact@RateMyCourse</strong>
